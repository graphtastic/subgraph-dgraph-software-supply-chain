# **Object Identification in GraphQL: A Definitive Report on Specification, Convention, and Modern Practice**

## **Part I: The Foundational Distinction: Specification vs. Convention**

A frequent point of confusion in GraphQL schema design is the role and requirement of unique identifiers. The assumption that every object, or "node," must have a unique id field is pervasive, yet its origin is often misunderstood. This report begins by establishing the crucial distinction between the formal GraphQL language specification, which is minimalist and flexible, and the powerful community-driven conventions that have been built upon it to enable the rich ecosystem of tooling that defines modern GraphQL development.

### **Section 1.1: What the GraphQL Specification Mandates (and What It Doesn't)**

The foundational GraphQL specification is fundamentally unopinionated regarding the presence of a unique id field on object types. A GraphQL schema can be perfectly valid according to the official specification without defining a single id field on any of its types. The core language is concerned with describing the capabilities of an API through a strongly-typed schema, allowing clients to request the exact shape of data they need.1

The specification does provide a built-in scalar type called ID. Its definition explicitly notes its intended purpose: "A unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as the key for a cache".1 The

ID type is serialized as a String, but its designation signals to developers and tools that its value is not intended to be human-readable.1 However, the specification merely provides this

ID type as a tool within the type system; it does not mandate its use on any object type.1 The design principles of GraphQL—being product-centric, hierarchical, and client-specified—focus on the structure and retrieval of data, not on prescribing a universal identity for every piece of data within that structure.2

This minimalism is a deliberate and critical architectural feature, not an oversight. The creators of GraphQL designed it to be a versatile query layer that could be placed in front of any number of disparate and heterogeneous data sources, including legacy databases, microservices, and third-party APIs.3 Many of these underlying systems may not have a concept of a unique, stable identifier for every piece of data they expose. For example, a data source might serve aggregated reports, transient log entries, or computed data that has no persistent identity. If the GraphQL specification had mandated a universal

id: ID\! field for all object types, it would have created a significant barrier to adoption, making it impossible to model these common data sources. By remaining unopinionated on object identity, the specification preserves the flexibility that is core to GraphQL's value proposition, allowing it to serve as a truly universal interface to existing systems.

### **Section 1.2: The Emergence of Convention: The Global Object Identification Specification**

The widespread assumption that every node requires a unique id stems not from the language specification but from a powerful and highly influential *convention*, formally captured in the GraphQL Global Object Identification (GOI) Specification.4 This convention was born from the practical necessities of building sophisticated client applications that required robust mechanisms for caching and data refetching.4

The origins of this specification are directly tied to Facebook's Relay, a JavaScript framework for building data-driven React applications.7 The GOI specification was, for a long time, known as the "Relay Global Object Identification Specification".8 The Relay framework's architecture is built on two core assumptions about a compliant GraphQL server: that it provides a mechanism for refetching an object by a unique identifier and a standardized way to page through connections.9 The former assumption is entirely dependent on the patterns defined in the GOI specification. To "elegantly handle for caching and data refetching," clients needed servers to expose object identifiers in a standardized way.5

This dynamic reveals a fundamental tension within the GraphQL ecosystem that has defined its evolution. The core specification provides a flexible, unopinionated language. However, to build powerful, feature-rich tools like automated caching clients (e.g., Relay, Apollo Client), those tools must impose their own, more stringent conventions on top of the language. The immense utility and improved developer experience offered by these tools led to the widespread adoption of their underlying conventions as community "best practices".8 This creates a powerful feedback loop: developers are often introduced to GraphQL through these opinionated client libraries and frameworks. They learn the conventions of the tools first and naturally assume them to be de jure requirements of the language itself. This explains why the user's initial query is so common; the de facto standard established by the tooling ecosystem is often mistaken for the de jure standard of the formal specification.

## **Part II: A Deconstruction of the Global Object Identification Pattern**

To understand why the Global Object Identification (GOI) convention has become a cornerstone of modern GraphQL development, it is necessary to deconstruct its components. The specification is simple in its definition but profound in its implications, establishing a formal contract between the server and client that enables a new class of application functionality.

### **Section 2.1: The Node Interface**

At the heart of the GOI specification is the Node interface. This interface establishes a simple yet powerful contract: any object type that can be uniquely identified and refetched by the client must implement this interface.4 The specification is precise and unambiguous in its requirements: "The server must provide an interface called

Node. That interface must include exactly one field, called id that returns a non-null ID".4

A schema that adheres to this specification would define the interface as follows:

GraphQL

\# An object with a Globally Unique ID  
interface Node {  
  \# The ID of the object.  
  id: ID\!  
}

An object type, such as User, would then implement this interface to signal its compliance with the contract:

GraphQL

type User implements Node {  
  id: ID\!  
  name: String\!  
  \#... other fields  
}

The most critical aspect of this contract is the nature of the id field. It must be a *globally unique identifier*.12 This means that an

id for a User object must not collide with an id for a Product object or any other object type in the entire schema. This guarantee of global uniqueness is what allows the refetching mechanism to be simple and universal, as the client can request any node without needing to know its type beforehand.

### **Section 2.2: The node Root Field**

The node root field is the functional counterpart to the Node interface. It provides a single, standardized entry point on the root Query type for clients to refetch any object in the graph, provided they know its globally unique ID.4 The specification mandates a root field named

node that accepts exactly one argument, id: ID\!, and returns the Node interface.6

The contract is explicit: if a client performs a query and receives an object that implements Node with a specific id, passing that same id value back to the node root field *must* return the identical object.4 A typical refetch query would look like this:

GraphQL

query RefetchUserQuery($userId: ID\!) {  
  node(id: $userId) {  
    id  
   ... on User {  
      name  
      email  
    }  
  }  
}

The specification includes a pragmatic "best effort" clause. It acknowledges that a server must make a best effort to fulfill the refetch request, but it may not always be possible. For example, the underlying database may be unavailable, or the requested object may have been deleted since it was last queried.4 This clause provides a necessary escape hatch for real-world operational failures.

### **Section 2.3: Guarantees of the Specification: Stability and Equality**

The GOI specification provides guarantees that extend beyond simple refetching, creating a foundation of data consistency that clients can rely upon. These guarantees of equality and stability transform the id from a simple identifier into a key that unlocks a powerful data consistency model.

The specification mandates object equality: "If two objects appear in a query, both implementing Node with identical IDs, then the two objects must be equal".4 This is a profound guarantee. It means that if a client requests

User with id "VXNlcjox" via a users list and also requests the same user via the node(id: "VXNlcjox") field in the same operation, the server promises that all fields queried on both representations of that user will be identical.

This equality is defined recursively through the principle of field stability. For any field queried on two objects with identical IDs, the results must be equal. This holds true whether the fields return scalars, enums, or even nested objects.4 This contract allows the client to trust the server's data implicitly. When a client receives data from multiple queries—for instance, a

viewer query might return a user object, and a post.author query might return what appears to be the same user object—it needs to know if these can be safely merged in its local cache. The GOI specification's id provides the key for this merge, and the equality and stability rules provide the *guarantee* that this merge is safe and correct. This trust is what enables a client to aggressively normalize its cache, confident that two objects with the same global ID are indeed the same canonical entity.

## **Part III: The Critical Role of Identifiers in the GraphQL Ecosystem**

The principles of object identification, particularly as formalized by the GOI specification, are not merely academic. Their adoption has profound and far-reaching consequences on the entire GraphQL development lifecycle, most notably on the client side, where they enable sophisticated patterns for state management, performance optimization, and architectural scalability.

### **Section 3.1: The Linchpin of Client-Side Caching**

Unique identifiers are the fundamental mechanism that enables modern GraphQL clients to perform data normalization. In a traditional REST architecture, the URL of a resource serves as a natural, globally unique identifier that can be used for HTTP caching.14 GraphQL, operating over a single endpoint, lacks this URL-based primitive. The

id field, as defined by convention, serves as its direct replacement, providing a globally unique key that clients can leverage to build rich, intelligent caches.14

Client libraries like Apollo Client and urql's graphcache use this identifier to transform the tree-like structure of a GraphQL query response into a flat, normalized data store.16 The process typically involves generating a unique cache key for each identifiable object by combining its

\_\_typename (a meta-field that returns the object's type name) with its key field, which is usually id or \_id. For example, a User object with an id of 123 would be stored in the cache under the key User:123.15

This normalized object is stored in a flat lookup table. When the same object—identified by the same cache key—appears in multiple query responses, its fields are merged into this single, canonical entry in the cache.16 This elegant process accomplishes two critical goals: it prevents data duplication, reducing the memory footprint of the application, and it ensures data consistency across the entire user interface. The cache can then fulfill future queries for that object, or even for individual fields of that object, directly from this local store without needing to make an unnecessary network request.16

### **Section 3.2: Consequences of Absent or Non-Unique Identifiers**

Operating a GraphQL API without a reliable system of unique identifiers severely cripples the capabilities of modern client libraries and forces developers back into a world of manual state management. This regression leads to a cascade of predictable and difficult-to-solve problems, including performance degradation, UI bugs, and a dramatic increase in application complexity.

* **Cache Ineffectiveness and Data Duplication:** If an object in a response lacks a unique identifier, the client cache cannot normalize it. Some clients may fall back to using the object's path within the query as a makeshift identifier.15 This is an extremely brittle strategy. The same conceptual object fetched via two different paths (e.g., through a  
  viewer query versus a posts.author query) will be treated as two distinct entities. This results in the same data being stored multiple times in the cache, bloating the application's memory usage.  
* **Inconsistent UI State:** The most user-facing consequence of failed normalization is a stale and inconsistent UI. If two components on the screen display data from the same logical entity but the client cannot identify it as such, an update to one will not be reflected in the other. For example, if a user updates their name in a profile settings view, a separate header component displaying their name will remain unchanged, showing stale data until a full page refresh occurs.  
* **Failure of Automatic Updates:** A key feature of clients like Apollo is their ability to automatically update the cache after a mutation. When a mutation returns an updated object, the client uses its unique ID to find the corresponding entry in the normalized cache and seamlessly merge the new data. This action triggers a reactive update in all UI components that are subscribed to that object or its fields.18 Without a unique ID, this entire automated process fails. The developer is forced to manually intervene, either by refetching all queries that might contain the updated data or by writing complex, imperative code to manually update the cache, reintroducing the very boilerplate and sources of error that GraphQL clients are designed to eliminate.  
* **Data Corruption from Non-Unique IDs:** The problem is even more severe if an identifier is present but not unique. For example, if an email field is used as a key but multiple users can share the same email, the client cache will incorrectly merge the data from these distinct entities into a single record. This leads to unpredictable data corruption, where one user's data overwrites another's, resulting in non-deterministic behavior that is extremely difficult to debug.21

### **Section 3.3: Beyond Caching: Data Refetching and Federation**

The benefits of unique identifiers extend beyond client-side caching to other critical architectural patterns that are central to building scalable and maintainable applications with GraphQL.

* **Standardized Data Refetching:** The GOI specification's node query provides a universal, efficient mechanism for refetching the latest state of any object in the graph.12 In an application without this pattern, if a client needs to refresh a single, deeply nested object (e.g., the author of a comment on a post), it is often forced to re-execute the original, potentially large and complex, query that first retrieved it. This is highly inefficient, consuming unnecessary server resources and network bandwidth. The  
  node query allows for a precise, targeted refetch of only the data that is needed.  
* **Enabling Federated Architectures:** In a modern microservices architecture, a single data entity may be composed of fields that are owned and served by different backend services. Apollo Federation is a powerful architecture for composing a unified supergraph from these distributed services (subgraphs). The lynchpin of this architecture is the @key directive, which is used in a subgraph's schema to declare the fields that uniquely identify an entity (e.g., type User @key(fields: "id")).21 The federated gateway uses this key to resolve and merge data for a single entity from multiple subgraphs. Without a reliable unique key, the gateway would have no way to understand that a  
  User object from the accounts subgraph is the same entity as a User object from the reviews subgraph. Thus, unique object identification is not just a best practice but a non-negotiable prerequisite for a federated graph.

The presence of reliable unique identifiers enables a fundamental paradigm shift in client-side development. It allows the application to move from an *imperative* model of data fetching ("fetch this query, then in the callback, manually find these five places in the UI state and update them") to a *declarative* one ("this component declares that it needs this data fragment for User:123"). In the declarative model, the client library takes on the responsibility of orchestrating the fetching, caching, and updating of data. This dramatically reduces boilerplate code, eliminates entire classes of state management bugs, and vastly simplifies application logic. The absence of unique identifiers forces developers back into the imperative world, negating one of the most significant practical advantages of using a modern GraphQL client ecosystem.

## **Part IV: Strategies for Implementing Global Identifiers**

Given the critical importance of unique identifiers, architects and developers must employ robust strategies for their implementation. The choice of strategy depends on the context of the project—whether it is a new (greenfield) application or an existing (brownfield) one—and the nature of the underlying data sources.

### **Section 4.1: Opaque Identifiers as a Best Practice**

A foundational best practice is that global IDs exposed by the GraphQL server should be treated as opaque strings by the client.9 The client should not attempt to parse or infer any information from the structure of the ID. The only valid use of the ID on the client is to store it and pass it back to the server for refetching or as an argument in a mutation.

Base64 encoding is a common and effective technique to enforce this principle.9 Encoding the ID makes it clear to consumers that it is an opaque token, not a simple database integer or a human-readable string. This practice creates a clean separation of concerns and a durable API contract. By treating the ID as opaque, the server retains the freedom to change its internal ID generation strategy in the future—for example, migrating from integer IDs to UUIDs—without breaking any clients, as long as the opaque ID remains a valid token for refetching. This adheres to Hyrum's Law, which observes that any observable behavior of an API will be depended upon by someone; making IDs opaque reduces the observable surface area and preserves future flexibility.12

### **Section 4.2: Synthesizing Global IDs**

In many real-world scenarios, especially when building a GraphQL layer over existing databases, the underlying data sources use type-specific, non-unique identifiers, such as auto-incrementing integers. In this common case, the GraphQL server is responsible for synthesizing a globally unique ID from the local, type-specific ID.

The most common and robust pattern is to combine the object's type name with its local ID and then encode the resulting string.7 For example, a

User object with a database primary key of 123 could have its global ID synthesized as base64('User:123'), which produces a unique and opaque string like VXNlcjoxMjM=.

The server's node resolver must then be able to perform the reverse operation. When it receives a global ID, it must first decode it (e.g., from Base64), parse the type name and the internal ID from the resulting string, and then use that information to route the request to the correct data source or database table to fetch the object.5 This pattern is used by numerous production systems and frameworks. For instance, Shopify's API generates IDs with a specific URI format like

gid://shopify/Product/123 25, while PostGraphile often uses a Base64-encoded JSON array like

\["Post", 1\] to represent the type and primary key.8

### **Section 4.3: Alternative Generation Schemes**

While synthesizing IDs from type names and local keys is a flexible and common approach, other strategies exist, each with its own set of trade-offs.

* **Database-Native UUIDs:** For greenfield projects where the database schema can be designed from the ground up, using Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) as primary keys is often the simplest and most direct approach. Since UUIDs are, by design, globally unique, they can be exposed directly as the id field in the GraphQL schema without any need for synthesis or encoding.14  
* **Dedicated ID Generation Services:** In very large-scale, distributed systems, it can be beneficial to use a dedicated service for generating unique, sortable IDs. A well-known example is Twitter's Snowflake, which generates 64-bit IDs that are composed of a timestamp, a machine ID, and a sequence number. This approach guarantees uniqueness across a distributed system and provides the added benefit of being roughly time-sortable.12  
* **Type-Prefixed IDs (Stripe-style):** Another effective strategy, popularized by APIs like Stripe's, is to store IDs in the database with a short, human-readable prefix that indicates the object's type (e.g., user\_..., prod\_...).12 These IDs are already globally unique and can be exposed directly. This approach offers improved debuggability, as the type of an object can be identified at a glance from its ID, while still being simple for the GraphQL layer to implement.

The following table provides a comparative analysis of these strategies to aid in architectural decision-making.

| Strategy | Implementation Complexity | Caching Support (Client) | Refetching Capability | Federation Compatibility | Pros | Cons |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Database UUID | Low | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent | Simple for greenfield; inherently unique. | Not always available in legacy systems; not time-sortable. |
| Synthesized Global ID (e.g., base64(Type:ID)) | Medium | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent | Works with any backend ID system; enforces opacity. | Requires logic on server to encode/decode; adds slight overhead. |
| Type-Prefixed ID (e.g., user\_123) | Low-Medium | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent | Human-readable for debugging; clear type association. | Requires buy-in at the database level; can be hard to retrofit. |
| Composite Key (Synthesized) | High | Good (with client config) | Good (with custom resolver) | Good (with complex @key) | Can model existing database schemas without modification. | Violates Node interface simplicity; requires client-side logic (keyFields). |
| No Unique ID | N/A | Poor (No Normalization) | Poor (Requires full query refetch) | Incompatible | Simple for transient or non-entity data. | Breaks caching, automatic updates, and federation; leads to bugs. |

## **Part V: Advanced Identification: Handling Composite Keys and Schemas Without IDs**

While the Global Object Identification pattern provides a clean model for objects with single primary keys, real-world data models are often more complex. This section addresses advanced scenarios, demonstrating how to apply the principles of object identification to systems with composite keys and how to thoughtfully design schemas that include types that genuinely lack a stable identity.

### **Section 5.1: Modeling Composite Keys in GraphQL**

It is common for database tables, particularly join tables in a relational model, to be uniquely identified by a composite primary key—a combination of two or more columns.19 The GraphQL type system, however, has no native concept of a composite key. The

Node interface, with its single id: ID\! field, requires a single, atomic identifier.

To reconcile this mismatch, the recommended server-side strategy is to create a synthetic single ID by combining the constituent parts of the composite key into a single, opaque string. This is an extension of the synthesis pattern described previously. For example, consider a UserGroupMembership type that represents a row in a join table identified by userId and groupId. The GraphQL server can create a stable, unique ID by concatenating these values with the type name and encoding the result: base64('UserGroupMembership:user\_123:group\_456').12

This approach allows the UserGroupMembership type to correctly implement the Node interface, preserving all the downstream benefits of standardized caching and refetching. The node resolver on the server would be responsible for decoding this ID, parsing the userId and groupId, and using them to query the correct row in the database.

### **Section 5.2: Client-Side Solutions for Complex Identification**

In some situations, a GraphQL server may expose types with composite identities but fail to provide a single, synthetic id field. While this is a sub-optimal schema design, modern client libraries provide powerful tools to handle this scenario gracefully on the client side, enabling normalization even without server-side adherence to the GOI specification.

Apollo Client's InMemoryCache allows developers to define a TypePolicy for any given type in the schema. Within this policy, the keyFields property can be used to instruct the cache on which fields to use to generate its internal, unique identifier.16 For an object with a composite key composed of

tokenId and key, the client could be configured as follows:

JavaScript

const cache \= new InMemoryCache({  
  typePolicies: {  
    InterviewParticipantInfo: {  
      keyFields: \["tokenId", "key"\],  
    },  
  },  
});

With this configuration, the cache will automatically generate a stable identifier for InterviewParticipantInfo objects by combining the values of their tokenId and key fields, resulting in a cache key like InterviewParticipantInfo:{"tokenId":"abc","key":"xyz"}.19 This

keyFields configuration is highly flexible and can even reference fields within nested objects to construct the identifier.31

This choice between synthesizing a global ID on the server versus using keyFields on the client represents a significant architectural trade-off. A server-provided global id establishes a single, canonical identifier for all consumers of the API. It creates a clean, universal contract, ensuring that any client—web, mobile, or otherwise—will handle object identity consistently. The server is the single source of truth for identity. In contrast, a client-configured keyFields policy provides immense flexibility and allows a client to work effectively even with non-ideal schemas. However, it couples the client's caching strategy directly to the field structure of the GraphQL type. If multiple, independently developed clients consume the same API, each client team must independently and correctly implement the same keyFields logic. This creates a risk of divergence and inconsistency. If the definition of uniqueness for a type changes in the backend, a server-side ID requires a change in only one place. A client-side keyFields approach requires a coordinated update across all clients. Therefore, server-authoritative global IDs promote a more robust, decoupled, and maintainable architecture in a multi-client ecosystem, while client-side keyFields are a powerful but more tightly coupled solution.

### **Section 5.3: Designing for "ID-less" Types**

Not every type in a GraphQL schema represents a true "entity" that requires a stable, unique identifier. Some types represent transient data, aggregated results, or value objects where the concept of a persistent identity is not applicable. In these cases, it is perfectly acceptable and correct to design the schema without an id field for those types.

Examples include:

* An AnalyticsReport type that represents a computed aggregation of data over a time range.  
* A PageInfo object within a paginated connection, which contains metadata about the current page of results.  
* Connection Edge types, which are containers for the Node and cursor and do not typically have their own identity.

It is crucial, however, to understand the consequences of this design choice for client-side caching. When a client cache encounters an object in a response that lacks a key (either because it has no id field or no keyFields policy), it cannot normalize that object. Instead, the object is embedded directly within its parent object in the cache store.16 This means the object cannot be accessed directly by an ID, and if it appears in multiple places in a response, it will be stored multiple times. Updates made to one instance will not be reflected in others. This behavior is perfectly acceptable for true value objects but would lead to the consistency problems described earlier if applied to entities. Modern clients allow for this behavior to be configured explicitly; for example, Apollo Client can be instructed not to normalize a specific type by setting

keyFields: false in its TypePolicy.

## **Part VI: Conclusion and Strategic Recommendations**

This report has systematically deconstructed the role of unique identifiers in GraphQL, moving from the formal specification to community conventions and their profound impact on the modern development ecosystem. The analysis reveals that while the core language is flexible, the practical demands of building high-performance, consistent, and scalable applications have led to a strong convergence on a set of best practices centered around object identification.

### **Section 6.1: Synthesis of Findings**

The key findings of this analysis can be synthesized into five main points:

1. **Unique IDs are a Convention, Not a Specification Requirement:** The base GraphQL specification does not mandate unique id fields. This flexibility is an intentional design feature that allows GraphQL to be a versatile layer over diverse data sources.  
2. **The GOI Spec is the Cornerstone of the Modern Ecosystem:** The convention of using a globally unique id field, as formalized in the Global Object Identification Specification, is the foundational pattern that enables the most powerful features of modern client libraries, including normalized caching, automatic UI updates, and standardized data refetching.  
3. **Deviating from Convention Has Severe Consequences:** Choosing to design a schema without a reliable unique identification strategy for entities leads to predictable and severe problems, including poor performance, inconsistent UI state, data corruption, and an inability to adopt advanced architectural patterns like federation.  
4. **Robust Strategies Exist for Complex Data Models:** Even when backend data models do not align perfectly with the single-ID pattern (e.g., they use composite keys), robust server-side strategies exist to synthesize globally unique IDs, allowing these models to conform to the GOI contract.  
5. **Client-Side Tooling Offers Powerful Workarounds:** Advanced client libraries provide flexible configurations (e.g., keyFields) that can create normalized caches even from schemas that do not provide a canonical id field. However, this approach introduces architectural trade-offs regarding client coupling and maintainability in multi-client environments.

### **Section 6.2: A Decision Framework for Schema Design**

To apply these findings, architects and API designers should use a structured decision framework when approaching object identification in their GraphQL schema. The following questions can guide this process:

1. **Project Context: Greenfield vs. Brownfield?** For a new, greenfield project, the Global Object Identification specification should be adopted from day one. There is little justification for not doing so. For a brownfield project layering GraphQL over existing systems, the primary task is to determine the best strategy (from Part IV) for synthesizing global IDs from the existing primary keys.12  
2. **Data Source Reality: What do your primary keys look like?** Analyze the primary keys in your underlying data sources. Do they use UUIDs, integers, or composite keys? This analysis will directly inform which implementation strategy—direct exposure, synthesis, or composite key concatenation—is most appropriate.  
3. **Client Ecosystem: How many distinct clients will consume this API?** If the API will be consumed by multiple, independently developed clients (e.g., a web app, an iOS app, and an Android app), a server-authoritative global id is strongly preferred. This establishes a single, unambiguous contract for identity and prevents the need to duplicate and synchronize complex identification logic across all clients.  
4. **Future Architecture: Is federation a possibility?** If a distributed graph composed via Apollo Federation is a likely future evolution for the system's architecture, then establishing a unique key for each entity (@key) is non-negotiable from the outset. Designing with this in mind will prevent a costly migration later.21  
5. **Entity vs. Value Object: Does every type need an ID?** Critically evaluate each type in the schema. Does it represent a true "entity" that has a stable identity and can be updated, or is it a transient "value object" that simply holds data? This distinction determines where it is not only acceptable but correct to omit an id field.

In conclusion, while not mandated by the formal GraphQL specification, a GraphQL schema that does not provide a mechanism for uniquely identifying its core entities is fundamentally incomplete from the perspective of modern application development. The Global Object Identification Specification should be considered the default, foundational best practice for any production-grade GraphQL API. The immense, compounding benefits to the client-side experience—including performance, data consistency, and developer productivity—far outweigh the implementation effort on the server. One should only deviate from this pattern with a clear, deliberate, and comprehensive understanding of the significant trade-offs and consequences.
