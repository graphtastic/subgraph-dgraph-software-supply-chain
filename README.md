# Subgraph: Dgraph Software Supply Chain

> ## ðŸš§ **Architectural Blueprints Ahead! ðŸš€**
>
> Welcome! This repository contains a **work-in-progress** implementation. While the code is still evolving, the architectural and design documentation here represents our north star for building a high-performance, federated graph for software supply chain security. We're excited to have you here and welcome you to explore the designs and join us in the discussions on CNCF Slack in [#initiative-supply-chain-security-insights](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C09A8VBEUNM).

## 1. Overview

This repository contains the source code, operational configuration, and detailed architectural documentation for the `subgraph-dgraph-software-supply-chain`. This service is a foundational ["Spoke"](https://github.com/graphtastic/platform/blob/main/docs/design/tome--graphtastic-platform-docker-compose.md#31-the-hub-and-spoke-model) within the [Graphtastic Platform](https://github.com/graphtastic/platform/blob/main/README.md#the-graphtastic-platform), designed to provide a high-performance, federated GraphQL API for software supply chain security data.

### 1.1. Strategic Goals

This subgraph serves two primary, strategic purposes:

1. **CNCF Demonstrator:** To act as a reference implementation and standalone demonstrator for the [[Initiative]: CNCF Software Supply Chain Insights Â· Issue #1709 Â· cncf/toc](https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1709).
2. **Federated Spoke:** To function as a fully compliant, federated Spoke within the Graphtastic supergraph, aggregating and exposing security data from multiple sources.

### 1.2. Core Technology

Our architecture is built on a foundation of powerful, cloud-native technologies:

* **Data Source:** [GUAC (Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition)](https://guac.sh/) instances, which generate rich software supply chain metadata.
* **Persistence Layer:** [Dgraph](https://dgraph.io/), a distributed, native GraphQL graph database chosen for its horizontal scalability and high-performance query capabilities.
* **API Layer:** A GraphQL API designed from the ground up to be compliant with the [Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/) specification, using [GraphQL Mesh](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/mesh) as a transformation sidecar.
* **Development Environment:** A modular, multi-stack [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) environment, orchestrated with `make` for a seamless and reproducible developer experience.

## 2. Environment Variables & Configuration

This project is fully configurable via environment variables defined in the `Makefile`. You can override any default by creating a `.env` file in the project root. See the `.env.example` file for a complete template.

| Variable | Default Value | Description |

| `EXTERNAL_NETWORK_NAME` | `graphtastic-network` | shared Docker network name that connects stacks' public API endpoint(s). |
| `COMPOSE_FILE` | `docker-compose.yml` | Main Compose file used by `make`. |
| **Universal Persistence** |||
| `PERSISTENCE_MODE` | `bind` | Global data storage mode: `bind` or `volume`. |
| `DATA_BASE_PATH` | `.` (project root) | Base path for all `bind` mounted data directories. |

*Note: Port mappings are also configurable as variables. See the `Makefile` or `.env.example` for a full list.*

### 2.1. Prerequisites

* Docker Engine and the Docker Compose CLI plugin
* `make`
* `wget` (for the `make fetch-benchmark-data` target)
* `nc` (netcat, for the `make validate` target)

### 2.2. Quickstart (demo)

This repository is configured to provide a complete, end-to-end demonstration of the data pipeline using a 1-million RDF triple benchmark dataset, with and without indexing, timed.

**To launch the entire demo, populate Dgraph with data, and start all services, run:**

```bash
make demo-1m
```

This single command will:

1. Clean any previous environment.
2. Create the necessary Docker networks and data directories/volumes.
3. Download the benchmark RDF data.
4. Run the Dgraph Bulk Loader to ingest the data.
5. Start the complete, populated application stack.

After the command completes, you can access the services:

* **Dgraph Ratel UI:** [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001)
* **Dgraph GraphQL Endpoint:** [http://localhost:8081/graphql](http://localhost:8081/graphql)
* **GUAC Mesh GraphQL Endpoint:** [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql)
* **GUAC GraphQL Endpoint (raw):** [http://localhost:8080/query](http://localhost:8080/query)

**TODO: add a good diagram here**

### 2.3. Day-to-Day Workflow

Once the demo is running, or if you want to start an empty environment, use the standard lifecycle commands.

1. **(First time only) Set up the environment:**

    ```bash
    make setup
    ```

2. **Launch the stack:**

    ```bash
    make up
    ```

3. **Validate the running environment:**

    ```bash
    make validate
    ```

4. **Tear down the environment:**

    ```bash
    make down
    ```

5. **Perform a full cleanup (deletes all data):**

    ```bash
    make clean
    ```

### 2.4. The Makefile Control Plane

All operational tasks are orchestrated via the Makefile. 

**Never run `docker` or `docker compose` directlyâ€”always use these targets defined in the Makefile..** 
* `make help` for a full list of available commands.
* If you find yourself wanting or needing to use `docker` or `docker compose`, please create an Issue. **PR's are warmly welcomed**!

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1. Network Architecture: A Two-Tiered Model

This project employs a deliberate, two-tiered network architecture to ensure both security and modularity. This approach allows each logical stack (like Dgraph or GUAC) to operate in isolation while selectively exposing public-facing APIs on a shared network.

**TODO: add a diagram**

* **Internal Networks (`dgraph_internal_net`, `guac_internal_net`, `mesh_internal_net` (coming soon):**
  * **Purpose:** Secure, private communication between the internal components of a single stack.
  * **Example:** `dgraph-alpha` communicates with `dgraph-zero` over `dgraph_internal_net`. These services are completely inaccessible from outside their stack.
  * **Analogy:** The private kitchen network in a restaurant.

* **Shared External Network (`graphtastic-network`):**
  * **Purpose:** A common network for services that need to expose an API endpoint to other stacks or to the host machine.
  * **Example:** `dgraph-alpha`, `guac-graphql`, and `guac-mesh-graphql` all attach to this network to expose their APIs. Development tools like the `extractor` also attach here to consume those APIs.
  * **Analogy:** The public-facing service counter of a restaurant.

This architecture strives to balance: **isolation for backend components** and **controlled, discoverable access for public-facing APIs**.

| [`design--guac-to-dgraph.md`](./docs/design/design--guac-to-dgraph.md) | The definitive implementation plan for this subgraph. It details the schema analysis, the two-phase ETL pipeline, data deduplication strategies, and the schema augmentation process for Dgraph. |
| [`on--running-multiple-docker-compose-stacks.md`](./docs/design/on--running-multiple-docker-compose-stacks.md) | The architectural blueprint for our modular local development environment.

| [`on--object-identification-in-graphql.md`](./docs/design/on--object-identification-in-graphql.md) | An in-depth report on the **Global Object Identification (GOI)** specification. This is essential reading to understand how we enable client-side caching, data refetching, and federation via unique `id` fields. |
| [`on--node-union-antipattern.md`](./docs/design/on--node-union-antipattern.md)                 | A critical analysis of why our schema consistently prefers **`interface`** types over `union` types for modeling polymorphic collections of entities, a decision crucial for schema evolvability and maintainability.        |
