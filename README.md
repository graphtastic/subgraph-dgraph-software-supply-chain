# Subgraph: Dgraph Software Supply Chain

> ## ðŸš§ **Architectural Blueprints Ahead! ðŸš€**
>
> Welcome! This repository contains a **work-in-progress** implementation. While the code is still evolving, the architectural and design documentation here represents our north star for building a high-performance, federated graph for software supply chain security. We're excited to have you here and welcome you to explore the designs and join us in the discussions on CNCF Slack in [#initiative-supply-chain-security-insights](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C09A8VBEUNM).

## 1. Overview

This repository contains the source code, operational configuration, and detailed architectural documentation for the `subgraph-dgraph-software-supply-chain`. This service is a foundational ["Spoke"](https://github.com/graphtastic/platform/blob/main/docs/design/tome--graphtastic-platform-docker-compose.md#31-the-hub-and-spoke-model) within the [Graphtastic Platform](https://github.com/graphtastic/platform/blob/main/README.md#the-graphtastic-platform), designed to provide a high-performance, federated GraphQL API for software supply chain security data.

### 1.1. Strategic Goals

This subgraph serves two primary, strategic purposes:

1.  **CNCF Demonstrator:** To act as a reference implementation and standalone demonstrator for the [CNCF Software Supply Chain Insights initiative](https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1709).
2.  **Federated Spoke:** To function as a fully compliant, federated Spoke within the Graphtastic supergraph, aggregating and exposing security data from multiple sources.

### 1.2. Core Technology

Our architecture is built on a foundation of powerful, cloud-native technologies:

*   **Data Source:** [GUAC (Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition)](https://guac.sh/) instances, which generate rich software supply chain metadata.
*   **Persistence Layer:** [Dgraph](https://dgraph.io/), a distributed, native GraphQL graph database chosen for its horizontal scalability and high-performance query capabilities.
*   **API Layer:** A GraphQL API designed from the ground up to be compliant with the [Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/) specification.
*   **Development Environment:** A modular, multi-stack [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) environment, orchestrated with `make` for a seamless and reproducible developer experience.

## 2. Architecture

This subgraph follows a decoupled, schema-driven ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) architecture to ingest data. The entire ingestion pipeline is an internal implementation detail, encapsulated within the Spoke's boundary. This "Spoke as a Black Box" approach is a core principle of the Graphtastic Platform, ensuring that the Spoke's public contract is its GraphQL API and nothing more.

### 2.1. Data Ingestion Flow

1.  **Extract & Transform:** A high-fidelity extractor tool queries one or more source GUAC GraphQL APIs. It uses GUAC's own pre-defined query files to ensure robustness. The extracted data is transformed into compressed RDF N-Quad files, a format optimized for Dgraph's loaders.
2.  **Load:** The generated RDF files are loaded into Dgraph using its high-performance native tooling (`dgraph bulk` for initial population and `dgraph live` for incremental updates).
3.  **Deduplication:** The Dgraph schema is programmatically augmented with `@id` directives on natural business keys. This pushes the responsibility for data deduplication down into the database layer, enabling idempotent upserts and ensuring that data from multiple GUAC sources is correctly merged into a single, canonical entity.

For a complete breakdown of this architecture, please see the core implementation design:

*   [**`docs/design/design--guac-to-dgraph.md`**](./docs/design/design--guac-to-dgraph.md)

## 3. Local Development

### 3.0. Makefile Targets: Developer Control Plane

All operational tasks are orchestrated via the Makefile. **Never run `docker` or `docker compose` directlyâ€”always use these targets.**

#### **Main Targets**

| Target                    | Description |
| :------------------------ | :---------- |
| `make help`               | Show this help message and a summary of all targets. |
| `make setup`              | Prepare the local environment (e.g., check `.env`, create necessary Docker networks). |
| `make up`                 | Bring up all services (full stack). |
| `make down`               | Bring down all services. |
| `make clean`              | Run `down`, then remove all containers, networks, persistent data, and benchmarking data. |
| `make status`             | Show container, network, and volume status (diagnostics). |
| `make logs`               | Tail logs for all running services. |

#### **Service Management**

| Target                                                     | Description |
| :--------------------------------------------------------- | :---------- |
| `make svc-up SVC=compose/xx.yml [SERVICE=service]`         | Bring up a specific compose file (and optionally a service). |
| `make svc-down SVC=compose/xx.yml [SERVICE=service]`       | Bring down a specific compose file (and optionally a service). |
| `make svc-logs SVC=compose/xx.yml [SERVICE=service]`       | Tail logs for a specific compose file (and optionally a service). |

#### **Data Pipeline**

| Target              | Description |
| :------------------ | :---------- |
| `make ingest-sboms` | Ingest SBOMs from the `./sboms` directory into GUAC. (Note: This targets GUAC's internal GraphQL API on `localhost:8080` *within its container*). |
| `make extract`      | Run the ETL script to extract from Mesh and generate RDF. |
| `make seed`         | Perform a full, clean data seed from SBOMs to Dgraph (end-to-end pipeline). |

#### **Benchmarking & Utilities**

| Target                          | Description |
| :------------------------------ | :---------- |
| `make fetch-benchmark-data`     | Download 1million RDF and schemas for benchmarking. |
| `make wipe-dgraph-data`         | Remove all Dgraph persistent data and build output (for benchmarking). |
| `make benchmark-bulk-indexed`   | Benchmark Dgraph bulk loader with indexed schema (wipes data first). |
| `make benchmark-bulk-noindex`   | Benchmark Dgraph bulk loader with no-index schema (wipes data first). |

#### **Other Utilities**

| Target                   | Description |
| :----------------------- | :---------- |
| `make stop-alpha`        | Stop only Dgraph Alpha containers. |
| `make start-alpha`       | Start only Dgraph Alpha containers. |
| `make check-dockerfiles` | Check for missing Dockerfiles referenced in compose files. |
| `make check-envfile`     | Ensure `.env` exists by copying from `.env.example` if needed. |

#### **Dual-Mode Tooling Pattern**

By default, all build, extraction, and schema composition tools are run in containers for reproducibility and CI/CD parity. For local development and fast iteration, you can run these tools natively by setting `USE_LOCAL_TOOLS=1` in your `.env` file:

```bash
echo "USE_LOCAL_TOOLS=1" >> .env
```

With this set, `make extract` and similar targets will run the scripts directly on your host (using your local Node.js environment). Remove or comment out this line to revert to containerized execution.

---

### 3.0. Storage Mode: Bind Mounts Only (for now)

Currently, GUAC Postgres data is stored in a local bind-mounted directory (`./dgraph-stack/guac-data`).

**TODO:** Add support for Docker named volumes for GUAC Postgres data.

-   Data is always stored in `./dgraph-stack/guac-data` on your host.
-   No Docker volume support for GUAC Postgres yet.

---

### 3.1. Network Architecture: Internal vs. External Access

This project uses two Docker networks for security and modularity:

*   **Internal network (`dgraph-net`)**: Used for private communication between Dgraph services (Zero, Alpha, Ratel). Not accessible from outside Docker.
*   **External network (`graphtastic_net`)**: Used to expose selected service endpoints to the host and to other stacks in the Graphtastic platform.

**Service network membership:**

| Service          | Internal (`dgraph-net`) | External (`graphtastic_net`) | Host Accessible? | Purpose                   |
| :--------------- | :---------------------: | :--------------------------: | :--------------: | :------------------------ |
| `dgraph-zero`    |            âœ”            |              âœ—               |        No        | Cluster coordination only |
| `dgraph-alpha`   |            âœ”            |              âœ”               |   Yes (API)      | GraphQL/DQL API, data plane |
| `dgraph-ratel`   |            âœ”            |              âœ”               |   Yes (UI)       | Web UI for admin/dev      |
| `guac-mesh-graphql` |            âœ”            |              âœ”               |   Yes (API)      | GraphQL Mesh endpoint     |

> **How are Ratel and GraphQL Mesh accessible from the host?**
>
> `dgraph-ratel` is accessible from your host because its service is attached to both the internal `dgraph-net` (for private communication with Dgraph Alpha) **and** the external `graphtastic_net` (which exposes its port to the host and other stacks). The Compose file maps port `8001` to your host, so you can open [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001) in your browser.
>
> Similarly, `guac-mesh-graphql` is attached to `graphtastic_net` and maps port `4000` to your host, making it accessible at [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql).

<details>
<summary><strong>How to debug the internal Docker network from the host</strong></summary>

Sometimes you need to inspect or debug services that are only on the internal Docker network (`dgraph-net`). Here are some useful techniques:

**1. Run a temporary debug container on the internal network:**

```bash
docker run -it --rm --network subgraph-dgraph-software-supply-chain_dgraph-net busybox sh
# or for more tools:
docker run -it --rm --network subgraph-dgraph-software-supply-chain_dgraph-net nicolaka/netshoot
```

You can now use tools like `ping`, `nslookup`, or `curl` to reach other containers by their service name (e.g., `dgraph-zero:5080`, `dgraph-alpha:8080`).

**2. Inspect the network and connected containers:**

```bash
docker network inspect subgraph-dgraph-software-supply-chain_dgraph-net
```

This will show which containers are attached and their internal IP addresses.

**3. Exec into a running service container:**

```bash
docker exec -it <container_name> sh
# Example:
docker exec -it dgraph-alpha sh
```

**4. Port-forward a service for temporary host access:**

If you need to access a service that's only on the internal network, you can use `docker port` or set up a temporary port-forward:

```bash
# Example: Forward dgraph-zero's HTTP port to your host
docker run --rm -it --network host alpine/socat TCP-LISTEN:16080,fork TCP:dgraph-zero:6080
# Now access http://localhost:16080 from your host
```

These techniques let you debug, inspect, or interact with internal-only services without changing your Compose files.

</details>

**How to access services:**

*   **From your host (browser or curl):**
    *   Dgraph Ratel UI: [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001)
    *   Dgraph GraphQL Endpoint: [http://localhost:8081/graphql](http://localhost:8081/graphql)
    *   Dgraph DQL API: [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
    *   GUAC Mesh GraphQL Endpoint: [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql)

*   **From inside a Docker container on `dgraph-net`:**
    *   Use service names: `dgraph-alpha:8080`, `dgraph-zero:5080`, `dgraph-ratel:8000`

*   **From inside a Docker container on `graphtastic_net`:**
    *   Use service names: `dgraph-alpha:8080`, `dgraph-ratel:8000`, `guac-mesh-graphql:4000`
    *   `dgraph-zero` is **not** available on this network for security/isolation.

**Why this matters:**

*   Only the API and UI endpoints you need are exposed to the host and other stacks. All cluster-internal traffic (e.g., Zero <-> Alpha) is isolated for security and reliability.

**Example: Accessing Dgraph from another container**

If you have a service on `graphtastic_net` (e.g., a Mesh gateway), you can connect to Dgraph Alpha at `dgraph-alpha:8080`.

If you are running a script inside the `dgraph-net` network, you can use the same service names, but only `dgraph-alpha` and `dgraph-ratel` are reachable from the external network.

This project uses a modular, multi-stack Docker Compose architecture orchestrated by a central `Makefile` to provide a simple and consistent developer experience.

### 3.1. Prerequisites

*   Docker Engine and the Docker Compose CLI plugin
*   `make`

### 3.2. Getting Started

**WARNING: this doesn't work yet! (WIP)**

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <this-repo-url>
    cd <this-repo-directory>
    ```

2.  **Configure the environment:**
    Copy the example environment file and customize it if necessary.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3.  **Launch the full stack:**
    This single command will create the shared Docker networks and volumes, then bring up the Dgraph cluster, the API service, and any other required components in the correct order.

    ```bash
    make up
    ```

4.  **Verify the services:**
    *   **Dgraph Ratel UI:** [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001)
    *   **Dgraph GraphQL Endpoint:** [http://localhost:8081/graphql](http://localhost:8081/graphql)
    *   **GUAC Mesh GraphQL Endpoint:** [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql)

## 3.3. Local vs. Containerized Tooling

By default, all build, extraction, and schema composition tools are run in containers for reproducibility and CI/CD parity. For local development and fast iteration, you can run these tools natively by setting `USE_LOCAL_TOOLS=1` in your `.env` file:

```bash
echo "USE_LOCAL_TOOLS=1" >> .env
```

With this set, `make extract` and similar targets will run the scripts directly on your host (using your local Node.js environment). Remove or comment out this line to revert to containerized execution.

This dual-mode workflow is documented in `PLAN.md` and enforced in the `Makefile`.

---

5.  **Ingest SBOMs and Run the ETL Pipeline**

To ingest SBOMs and load them into Dgraph, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Place your SBOM files**

Copy your SBOM files (e.g., `.spdx.json`, `.cyclonedx.json`) into the `./sboms` directory:

```bash
cp /path/to/your/sbom1.spdx.json ./sboms/
cp /path/to/your/sbom2.cyclonedx.json ./sboms/
```

**Step 2: Ingest SBOMs into GUAC**

Run the following command to ingest all SBOMs in the `./sboms` directory:

```bash
make ingest-sboms
```

**Step 3: Wait for GUAC to finish processing**

Monitor the GUAC containers to ensure ingestion is complete. You can check logs with:

```bash
docker compose -f compose/guac.yml logs -f guac-collectd guac-api guac-graphql```

Once logs indicate processing is finished (or after a reasonable wait), proceed.

**Step 4: Export data from Mesh to RDF (N-Quads)**

Run the extractor script (now located in `guac-mesh-graphql/scripts/extractor.ts`) to pull data from the Mesh GraphQL gateway and generate RDF N-Quads:

```bash
make extract
```

This will create a compressed RDF file in `guac-mesh-graphql/build/guac.rdf.gz`.

**Step 5: Seed Dgraph with the extracted RDF**

The full pipeline (including all steps above) can be run with:

```bash
make seed```

This will clean the environment, bring up all services, ingest SBOMs, extract RDF (from `guac-mesh-graphql/build/guac.rdf.gz`), and (when implemented) load into Dgraph.
> **Note:** All Mesh transformation and extraction logic is now contained within the `guac-mesh-graphql/` subdirectory. This ensures proper Compose layering and allows `compose/guac.yml` to mount and access the extractor and its outputs directly.

---

6.  **Tear down the environment:**
To stop all containers and remove the Docker network, run:

```bash
make down
```

7.  **Perform a full cleanup:**
To stop containers and **permanently delete all persistent data**, run:

```bash
make clean
```

## 4. Project Documentation & Design Philosophy
