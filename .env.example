# TOOLING MODE
# Set to 1 to run build/extract/composition tools natively on your host machine.
# By default (or if unset), tools run inside containers for reproducibility.
# USE_LOCAL_TOOLS=1

# SHARED RESOURCES
# Defines the name of the shared Docker network that connects services from different stacks.

# DGRAPH CONFIG
DGRAPH_ALPHA_WHITELIST=0.0.0.0/0

# Dgraph data storage mode. Determines how Dgraph persists its data.
# - 'bind': (Default) Mounts a local directory from ./dgraph-stack into the container.
#           Easy to inspect data on the host. Recommended for most local development.
# - 'volume': Use Docker-managed named volumes. More portable, but data is managed
#             by the Docker daemon and is harder to inspect directly.
DGRAPH_DATA_MODE=bind

# If using DGRAPH_DATA_MODE=volume, set the Docker named volume names here.
